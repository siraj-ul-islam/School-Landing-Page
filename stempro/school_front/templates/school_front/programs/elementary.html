    <div class="faqItemBody" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
        
        <p itemprop="text">The “Russian” comes from our approach - which is based on elite math schools in the former Soviet Union, adapted to the U.S. environment. 

According to Russian tradition - the study of mathematics is the pre-eminent tool of mental development. We teach math in a way that not only builds mathematical excellence, but also develops intellect and character.</p>

    <summary><h3 itemprop="name">Where does your curriculum come from?</h3></summary>
    <div class="faqItemBody" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
        
        <p itemprop="text">We offer one continuous curriculum, from K-12. Our curriculum and methodology, perfected over 20 years by our team of gifted academics, is inspired by elite mathematical schools in the former Soviet Union, adapted for the American educational environment.</p>

            </div>

<details class="faqItem" itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
    <summary><h3 itemprop="name">How big are your classes? What is the teacher to student ratio? </h3></summary>
    <div class="faqItemBody" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
        
        <p itemprop="text">Our average class size is 12, and with three levels per grade we&#039;re able to ensure that each child is placed in a class that is appropriately challenging. Classrooms are an essential part of our methodology and curriculum as the environment enables students to verbalize and debate their ideas and exposes them to different ways of thinking.</p>

<details class="faqItem" itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
    <summary><h3 itemprop="name">How long are your classes? Can an elementary school child sit that long?</h3></summary>
    <div class="faqItemBody" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
        
        <p itemprop="text">Our class-times vary depending on a child’s age. Starting anywhere from 1.5 hours for kindergarteners to  2-4 hours in high school. In the younger grades, we regularly mix activities and work with manipulatives to keep students engaged.</p>

            </div>
</details>
<details class="faqItem" itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
    <summary><h3 itemprop="name">How much homework should I expect?</h3></summary>
    <div class="faqItemBody" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
        
        <p itemprop="text">The goal of homework is to reinforce what was taught in class. Our teachers assign just enough to strengthen the skills developed in class. Homework is an excellent tool for you to gauge your child’s learning. It should take approximately half the length of your child’s lesson to complete. If the homework takes an unreasonably long or short amount of time, that may be a red flag indicating that your child is not in an appropriate level.</p>

        <p itemprop="text">All of our teachers have a background in mathematics or a related field and have a passion for the subject. They also go through extensive training to teach according to our specific methodology and curriculum.</p>

        <p itemprop="text">It takes many years to develop a deep mathematical foundation as well as the type of mindset we focus on building. With mathematics, as with a language or a sport, the earlier a child starts the better. Our students begin to reason with abstract concepts in elementary school, and by middle school they are not only familiar with essential elements of algebra but can easily apply them in problem solving. </p>

        <p itemprop="text">We have designed multiple levels for every grade specifically to be able to serve each child&#039;s development based on his or her knowledge and ability. We recommend scheduling a free evaluation, as these sessions enable us to get a sense of each child&#039;s needs and recommend a class that is best suited to him or her.  </p>

    <div class="faqItemBody" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
        
        <p itemprop="text">The concepts that we cover are fundamental and we study them in depth. Children see concepts from a variety of different angles. This doesn’t lead to confusion but rather empowers students by deepening their understanding. 

Since our curriculum is generally ahead of public school, children will often first learn concepts at RSM. Once they master them, we find they can adapt to any school format.</p>
